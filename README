Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

Method of application:

cd linux-cedrus

sudo -i

make CROSS_COMPILE=aar ACRH=arm64 menuconfig


make CROSS_COMPILE=aar ACRH=arm64 -j8



make-kpkg --initrd --revision 20180810 --append-to-servion -sunxiarm64  kernel_image

dpkg -i linux-image-4.18.0-rc4-sunxiarm64_20180810_arm64.deb

This command can see only the kernel installed using the KPKG command:

	dpkg --get-selections | grep linux

Delete the old kernel boot entries:
	apt-get remove linux-headers-xx   linux-image-xx

cd /boot/

rm -r "old linux image and old vmlinuz-XXX"
	rm -r Image
	rm -r vmlinuz-XXX

new kernel image:

	chmod 755 vmlinuz-4.18.0-rc4-sunxiarm64
	ln -s vmlinuz-4.18.0-rc4-sunxiarm64 Image
	
reboot
